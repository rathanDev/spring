Using object-oriented concepts, create a web application that accepts a string and does the following to it:
- converts the string to uppercase and outputs it to brower.
- converts the string to alternate upper and lower case and outputs it to brower.
- creates a CSV format from the string by making each character a column in the CSV and then output "CSV created!" to brower.

Make sure the code unit-testable and extendable.

Example: when the input: "hello world", we should see the following in brower:
    HELLO WORLD
    hElLo wOrLd
    CSV created!
...and a CSV file containing the following: h,e,l,l,o, ,w,o,r,l,d
